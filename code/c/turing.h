/*
This source file and the program based on it is meant to help me visualize the output of bitwise operations for the Steam game "Turing Complete". I am very familiar with bitwise operations but seeing them visually and verifying them with a valid program will help me figure out how some gates are used to make other gates.

This functions uses the standard C operators to achieve the result of all the bitwise operations of 2 input bits.
