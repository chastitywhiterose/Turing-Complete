Terms are described in the order they occur in the game, generally with a few exceptions. In the game, red=off=0 and green=on=1

## NAND Gate

The NAND gate returns 0 if both bits are 1. Otherwise the result is 1. It is the same as the AND gate with the result inverted.

## NOT Gate

If the same bit is set to both inputs of a NAND gate, the result will always be the opposite of whatever the original input bit is. Off becomes on, on becomes off.

## AND Gate

The NAND gate returns 1 if both bits are 1. Otherwise the result is 0. It is the same as the NAND gate with the result inverted.
